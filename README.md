# crossroad

Simulation of an intersection using Arduino. It includes traffic lights for the main and side roads, pedestrian lights. One button switches between night and day mode, while the other simulates passing cars. The current mode of the intersection and the number of passing cars are displayed on the LCD. If 5 cars do not pass within 5 seconds in night mode, the car counter will reset. Switching to day mode occurs automatically after the fifth car passes.
